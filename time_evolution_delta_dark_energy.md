# Time Evolution of δ and Dark Energy in SPU

## Abstract

In the SPU framework, the parameter $\delta$ quantifies the degree of incomplete saturation of a finite fermionic capacity. Since $\delta$ originates from dynamical RG effects and emergent collective phenomena, it is not expected to be strictly constant over cosmological time. This document explores the logical and semi-quantitative consequences of a time-dependent $\delta$ and its implications for the evolution of dark energy in SPU.

## 1. Motivation

In standard cosmology, dark energy is often modeled as a strict cosmological constant. In SPU, however:

- Vacuum energy is emergent and non-extensive
- Gravity is induced dynamically
- $\delta$ is generated through RG and collective dynamics

It is therefore natural to ask whether $\delta$ may evolve slowly with cosmic time and how this would affect dark energy.

---

## 2. Origin of δ and Its Scale Dependence

In SPU, $\delta$ arises from:

- Partial dynamical decoupling of fermionic modes
- Interaction with emergent defects or collective excitations
- RG flow between microscopic and macroscopic scales

As a consequence, $\delta$ should be viewed as an effective parameter:

$$\delta = \delta(\mu)$$

where $\mu$ is the relevant physical scale. In a cosmological context, $\mu$ is naturally tied to the Hubble scale $H(t)$.

---

## 3. From Scale Dependence to Time Dependence

Identifying the RG scale with the cosmological curvature scale:

$$\mu \sim H(t)$$

implies:

$$\delta(t) \equiv \delta(H(t))$$

This does not introduce new degrees of freedom but reflects the fact that the effective saturation of the fermionic medium depends on the background spacetime curvature.

## 4. Vacuum Energy with Time-Dependent δ

From the semi-analytical estimate established previously:

$$\rho_\Lambda(t) \sim \delta(t) \times H(t)^2 \times M_{\text{Pl}}^2$$

This relation implies:

- Dark energy tracks the expansion rate
- Its magnitude decreases slowly as $H(t)$ decreases
- Exact constancy is not required

At late times, when $H(t)$ varies slowly, $\rho_\Lambda$ behaves approximately as a cosmological constant.

## 5. Equation of State

The effective equation of state parameter $w$ is defined as:

$$w = \frac{p_\Lambda}{\rho_\Lambda}$$

In SPU:

- If $\delta$ is strictly constant, $w = -1$
- If $\delta$ varies slowly, $w$ deviates slightly from $-1$

The expected deviation is small:

$$|w + 1| \ll 1$$

and naturally compatible with current observational bounds.

## 6. Absence of Fine Tuning

No tuning is required because:

- $\delta$ is $O(0.1–1)$
- Its evolution is controlled by RG flow
- The Hubble scale provides the only relevant IR parameter

The smallness of dark energy arises from the smallness of $H(t)$, not from cancellations.

---

## 7. Observational Signatures

A slowly evolving $\delta$ implies:

- Mild redshift dependence of dark energy
- Possible deviation from ΛCDM at late times
- Testable effects in precision cosmology (BAO, SNe Ia, weak lensing)

SPU therefore makes **falsifiable predictions** beyond a pure cosmological constant.

---

## 8. Consistency with Earlier SPU Results

The evolution of $\delta$:

- Does not affect gauge coupling unification
- Does not destabilize $N_f^{\text{eff}}$
- Does not modify particle physics observables

This separation of scales ensures internal consistency.

---

## 9. Limitations

At the present stage, SPU does not provide:

- A closed differential equation for $\delta(t)$
- A unique prediction for $w(z)$
- A full cosmological perturbation theory

These require extending SPU to a complete cosmological effective theory.

---

## 10. Falsification Criteria

SPU would be challenged if observations show:

- Large deviations of $w$ from $-1$
- Rapid time variation of dark energy
- Evidence for extensive vacuum energy contributions

---

## 11. Conclusion

In SPU, dark energy is not a rigid cosmological constant but an **emergent, slowly evolving phenomenon** controlled by $\delta$ and spacetime curvature. A mild time dependence is natural, observationally allowed, and conceptually consistent with the dynamical origin of gravity and vacuum energy in the framework.
