# Why δ Cannot Be Zero

## A Consistency Argument in the SPU Framework

## Abstract

In the SPU framework, the parameter $\delta$ quantifies the partial dynamical decoupling of fermionic degrees of freedom from renormalization group (RG) running. This document demonstrates that the limit $\delta = 0$ is internally inconsistent. The argument relies solely on RG stability, decoupling behavior, and effective field theory principles, without invoking phenomenological inputs.

## 1. Definition of the δ → 0 Limit

By construction,

$$N_f^{\mathrm{eff}} = 128 - \delta$$

The limit $\delta = 0$ corresponds to **full participation** of all nominal fermionic degrees of freedom in RG running. This scenario will be examined for consistency.

## 2. RG Instability at δ = 0

At one loop, gauge beta functions read:

$$\beta(g_i) = -\frac{b_i}{16\pi^2} g_i^3, \quad b_i = b_i^{\text{gauge}} - c_i N_f^{\mathrm{eff}}$$

Setting $\delta = 0$ yields:

$$N_f^{\mathrm{eff}} = 128$$

which drives at least one of the coefficients $b_i$ to zero or negative values.

Consequences:
- loss of asymptotic freedom or control,
- RG trajectories become unstable or non-perturbative below the unification scale.

Thus, $\delta = 0$ violates RG consistency.

## 3. Failure of Dynamical Decoupling

The SPU framework assumes that some fermionic modes are **quasi-critical**, acquiring effective masses through dynamical interactions.

If $\delta = 0$, then:
- all modes remain exactly massless,
- no suppression factor appears in loop integrals,
- decoupling never occurs.

This contradicts the assumed effective field theory structure, where heavy or interacting modes must gradually decouple.

## 4. Absence of a Stable Fixed Point

The dynamical origin of $\delta$ is tied to a balance between:
- loop-induced mass generation,
- RG flow of couplings.

For $\delta = 0$, this balance collapses:
- induced masses vanish,
- no nontrivial fixed point exists.

The system becomes either trivial or unstable.

## 5. EFT Interpretation

From an EFT perspective:
- exact $\delta = 0$ requires infinite fine tuning,
- generic quantum corrections immediately generate $\delta > 0$.

Therefore, $\delta = 0$ is not technically natural.

---

## 6. Conclusion

The limit $\delta = 0$ is excluded by:
- RG instability,
- absence of decoupling,
- lack of a stable fixed point,
- violation of technical naturalness.

$$\boxed{\delta > 0 \quad \text{is a necessary condition of consistency}}$$

This establishes $\delta$ as an unavoidable dynamical feature of the SPU framework.
