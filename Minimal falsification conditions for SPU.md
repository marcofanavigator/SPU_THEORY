# Minimal Falsification Conditions for the SPU Framework

## Abstract

A physical theory must specify not only what it explains, but also **under which conditions it would be ruled out**.

This document lists the minimal, model-independent falsification criteria for the SPU framework.

---

## 1. Principle of Falsifiability

SPU is built to be **falsifiable** through:

- Renormalization-group dynamics
- Emergence of gravity
- Early-universe signatures

**No anthropic arguments or parameter tuning are invoked.**

---

## 2. Failure of RG Fixed Point for δ

### Prediction

The RG flow of the parameter δ must exhibit:

- A **non-trivial infrared fixed point**
- With value:

$$0.5 \lesssim \delta_{\text{IR}} \lesssim 0.7$$

### Falsification

SPU is **ruled out** if:

- δ flows to **0 or 1 generically**
- δ has **no stable infrared behavior**
- δ **requires fine-tuned initial conditions**

---

## 3. Absence of Dynamical Unification Scale

### Prediction

Gauge couplings converge dynamically at:

$$\mu_{\text{GUT}} \sim 10^{16} \text{ GeV}$$

**without supersymmetry or threshold tuning.**

### Falsification

SPU is **ruled out** if:

- Convergence **does not occur** for the same $N_f^{\text{eff}}$
- **Different gauge sectors require different parameters**
- **Unification scale must be imposed by hand**

---

## 4. Non-Emergence of Gravity

### Prediction

Gravity **must emerge** when:

- δ **reaches its fixed point**
- **Fermionic capacity saturates**

This implies:

- A **dynamically generated Planck scale**
- **Universal coupling to matter**

### Falsification

SPU is **ruled out** if:

- **Gravity must be postulated independently**
- **Newton's constant cannot be linked to** $N_f^{\text{eff}}$
- **Gravitational coupling is non-universal**

---

## 5. Violation of Classical GR at Low Energies

### Prediction

At energies:

$$E \ll \mu_{\text{GUT}}$$

SPU **must reduce to classical GR**.

### Falsification

SPU is **ruled out** if:

- **Deviations from GR appear** in solar-system tests
- **Equivalence principle violations are unavoidable**
- **Extra long-range degrees of freedom persist**

---

## 6. Absence of Primordial Tensor Modes

### Prediction

A stochastic gravitational-wave background with:

$$r \gtrsim 10^{-2}$$

is a **generic consequence** of gravity emergence.

### Falsification

SPU is **disfavored** if:

- **No primordial tensor modes** observed down to $r < 10^{-3}$
- **Early-universe signatures are completely absent**

---

## 7. Dependence on Arbitrary Parameters

### Prediction

SPU contains:

- **No tunable dimensionless parameters**
- **No adjustable potentials**
- **No arbitrary cutoffs**

### Falsification

SPU is **ruled out** if:

- **Agreement with data requires parameter tuning**
- **Multiple unrelated scales must be introduced**

---

## 8. Summary Table

| Criterion | Prediction | Falsification |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| **RG flow of δ** | Stable IR fixed point | δ unstable or tuned |
| **Unification** | Dynamic at $10^{16}$ GeV | Sector-dependent |
| **Gravity** | Emergent | Fundamental input |
| **GR limit** | Exact at low E | Observable deviations |
| **Early universe** | Tensor modes | No signal |
| **Parameters** | None | Fine tuning |

---

## 9. Conclusion

SPU is **falsifiable on multiple independent fronts**.

**Failure of any single core prediction** would be sufficient to rule it out.

**This is a feature, not a weakness.**
