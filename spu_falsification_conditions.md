# Minimal Falsification Conditions

## How the SPU Framework Can Be Ruled Out

## Abstract

A viable physical theory must specify conditions under which it can be falsified. This document formulates the minimal falsification criteria for the SPU framework. Each condition is internal, sharp, and testable in principle, ensuring that SPU does not rely on post-hoc adjustment.

## 1. Structural Predictions of SPU

SPU makes the following nontrivial claims:

1. A fixed nominal fermionic capacity:
   $$N_f^{\mathrm{nom}} = 128$$

2. A dynamical reduction:
   $$N_f^{\mathrm{eff}} = 128 - \delta, \quad \delta > 0$$

3. Smooth RG running with no intermediate fine tuning.

These features are rigid and not adjustable independently.

## 2. Falsification Condition I: RG Inconsistency

If no value of $\delta$ exists such that:
- all gauge couplings remain perturbative,
- RG flows are stable up to the unification scale,

then the SPU framework is falsified.

---

## 3. Falsification Condition II: Absence of a Viable δ Window

SPU predicts a finite consistency interval:

$$\delta_{\min} < \delta < \delta_{\max}$$

If future refined calculations show:
- $\delta_{\min} \ge \delta_{\max}$,

then SPU is internally inconsistent and falsified.

---

## 4. Falsification Condition III: Discrete Capacity Violation

The value $N_f^{\mathrm{nom}} = 128$ arises from a fixed topological structure. If it is shown that:
- the underlying structure cannot support a discrete fermionic capacity,
- or predicts a different value,

then the foundational assumption of SPU fails.

---

## 5. Falsification Condition IV: Non-universality

SPU predicts that low-energy observables should be **insensitive** to small variations of $\delta$ within the allowed window.

If:
- observables depend sharply or discontinuously on $\delta$,
- fine tuning is required to match observations,

then SPU loses predictive power and is falsified.

---

## 6. Falsification Condition V: Experimental Tension

Although SPU does not fit parameters, it implies:
- a unification scale within a narrow range,
- specific qualitative expectations (e.g., no SUSY at low scales).

If experiments definitively exclude all such ranges simultaneously, SPU is falsified.

---

## 7. Summary

SPU is falsifiable if **any** of the following occur:

- no consistent $\delta > 0$ exists,
- RG stability fails,
- the discrete fermionic capacity is invalid,
- universality is violated,
- experimental exclusions eliminate all viable regimes.

$$\boxed{\text{This satisfies the minimal criterion for a scientific theory.}}$$
