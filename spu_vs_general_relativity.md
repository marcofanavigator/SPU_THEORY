# SPU vs General Relativity

## Classical Limit and Recovery of Einstein Equations

## Abstract

This document explains how classical General Relativity (GR) is recovered within the SPU framework.

SPU does not modify Einstein's equations at macroscopic scales; instead, it provides a **dynamical origin** for the Einstein–Hilbert action and clarifies the regime in which classical gravity emerges.

## 1. What Must Be Recovered

Any viable theory of emergent gravity must reproduce, in the appropriate limit:

$$G_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G_N T_{\mu\nu}$$

with:

- Universal coupling to energy–momentum
- Local Lorentz invariance
- Equivalence principle at observable scales

**SPU is required to satisfy these conditions without introducing ad hoc assumptions.**

---

## 2. Gravity Is Not Fundamental in SPU

In SPU:

- Gravity is **not a fundamental interaction**
- There is **no graviton in the UV description**
- Spacetime geometry is an **effective description**

Gravity appears only after:

- RG flow of δ reaches its **infrared fixed point**
- Fermionic degrees of freedom **saturate their effective capacity**

---

## 3. Emergence of the Einstein–Hilbert Action

Below the emergence scale $\mu_{\text{GUT}}$, collective fluctuations generate an effective action:

$$S_{\text{eff}} = \int d^4x \sqrt{-g} \left[ M_{\text{Pl}}^2 R + \Lambda_{\text{eff}} + O(R^2) \right]$$

### Key Points

- The **Einstein–Hilbert term is dominant**
- Higher-curvature corrections are **suppressed by** $\mu_{\text{GUT}}^{-2}$
- **No extra scalar or vector gravitational modes** are required

This structure **matches the low-energy effective action of GR**.

## 4. Origin of the Planck Mass

The effective Planck mass arises as:

$$M_{\text{Pl}}^2 \propto N_f^{\text{eff}} \cdot \mu_{\text{GUT}}^2$$

where:

- $N_f^{\text{eff}} = 128 - \delta_{\text{IR}}$
- $\delta_{\text{IR}}$ is **fixed dynamically by RG flow**

Thus:

- The **weakness of gravity is explained**
- **Newton's constant is not fundamental**
- **Gravity strength is linked to particle physics**

---

## 5. Universality and the Equivalence Principle

In SPU:

- All matter fields originate from the **same fermionic sector**
- Gravitational coupling depends **only on total energy–momentum**
- **No species-dependent couplings** appear

Therefore:

- The **equivalence principle is preserved automatically**
- Violations are **suppressed by powers of** $\mu / \mu_{\text{GUT}}$

---

## 6. Classical Limit

The classical GR regime corresponds to:

$$E \ll \mu_{\text{GUT}}$$

In this limit:

- δ is **frozen at its fixed point**
- RG flow is **negligible**
- Spacetime curvature **varies slowly**

As a result:

- **Einstein equations emerge as effective equations of motion**
- **Quantum corrections are negligible**

---

## 7. No Modification of GR at Astrophysical Scales

SPU predicts:

- **No MOND-like corrections**
- **No extra long-range forces**
- **No deviation from GR** in solar-system tests

Any deviation from GR appears only:

- **Near** $\mu_{\text{GUT}}$
- **Or in the early Universe**

## 8. Comparison Table

| Aspect | General Relativity | SPU |
|--------|-------------------|-----|
| **Gravity fundamental** | Yes | No |
| **Planck scale** | Input | Emergent |
| **Equivalence principle** | Assumed | Emergent |
| **Quantum origin** | External | RG-driven |
| **Classical limit** | Fundamental | Effective |

## 9. What SPU Does *Not* Claim

SPU does **not** claim:

- A quantization of GR
- Resolution of black hole singularities
- Modification of classical gravity tests

Its claim is **strictly about origin**, not alteration.

---

## 10. Conclusion

SPU **recovers General Relativity** as a **low-energy effective theory**.

Einstein's equations are **not postulated** but **arise dynamically** once the RG flow of fermionic degrees of freedom saturates.

In this sense, **SPU explains *why* GR works** — without changing *how* it works.
