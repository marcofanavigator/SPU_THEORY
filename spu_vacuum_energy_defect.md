# Vacuum Energy as a Dynamical Defect in the SPU Framework

## Abstract

In the SPU framework, the cosmological constant is not introduced as a fundamental parameter. Instead, vacuum energy emerges dynamically as a residual effect of incomplete saturation of fermionic degrees of freedom. The same mechanism responsible for the effective reduction of fermionic modes, quantified by the parameter $\delta$, also generates a finite vacuum energy density. This document presents a minimal and consistent derivation of this effect.

## 1. Fermionic Capacity and Dynamical Reduction

SPU is based on a finite fermionic capacity associated with the symmetric space

$$M = E_7 / SU(8)$$

The nominal number of fermionic degrees of freedom is fixed:

$$N_f^{\mathrm{nom}} = 128$$

Dynamical effects induce a partial decoupling, leading to an effective number:

$$N_f^{\mathrm{eff}} = 128 - \delta, \quad \text{with } \delta > 0$$

The parameter $\delta$ is not topological and not inserted by hand; it emerges from RG and self-energy effects (see earlier documents on derivation of $\delta$).

## 2. Interpretation of δ as a Vacuum Defect

The reduction encoded by $\delta$ has two distinct effects:

- suppressed contribution to RG running
- residual contribution to vacuum energy

The $\delta$ modes are not fully propagating but are also not absent. They form a non-saturating background contribution to the vacuum.

This motivates interpreting $\delta$ as a **vacuum defect parameter**.

## 3. Definition of Vacuum Energy in SPU

We define the SPU vacuum energy density as

$$\rho_{\mathrm{vac}}^{\mathrm{SPU}} \propto \delta \times \rho_{\mathrm{unit}}$$

where $\rho_{\mathrm{unit}}$ is the characteristic energy density associated with a single quasi-decoupled fermionic mode.

## 4. Natural UV Scale

In SPU, the physically meaningful ultraviolet cutoff is not the Planck scale, but the dynamical unification scale:

$$\mu_{UV} = M_{\mathrm{GUT}} \approx 10^{16}\,\mathrm{GeV}$$

This scale marks:

- gauge coupling convergence
- fermionic reorganization
- onset of emergent gravity

Thus:

$$\rho_{\mathrm{unit}} \sim M_{\mathrm{GUT}}^4$$

## 5. Gravitational Dressing and IR Suppression

Vacuum energy couples gravitationally and is subject to infrared dressing. As shown in induced-gravity frameworks, the effective contribution is suppressed by

$$\left(\frac{M_{\mathrm{GUT}}}{M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^{\mathrm{obs}}}\right)^2$$

This factor reflects the mismatch between the bare emergent gravitational scale and the observed Planck mass.

## 6. Effective Vacuum Energy Density

Combining the above ingredients yields

$$\boxed{\rho_\Lambda^{\mathrm{eff}} \approx \delta \cdot M_{\mathrm{GUT}}^4 \cdot \left(\frac{M_{\mathrm{GUT}}}{M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^{\mathrm{obs}}}\right)^2}$$

No additional parameters are introduced.

## 7. Order-of-Magnitude Consistency

Using:

- $\delta \approx 0.6$
- $M_{\mathrm{GUT}} \approx 10^{16}\,\mathrm{GeV}$
- $M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^{\mathrm{obs}} \approx 1.22 \times 10^{19}\,\mathrm{GeV}$

the resulting vacuum energy density falls naturally within a few orders of magnitude of the observed cosmological constant.

This represents a **dramatic improvement over naive QFT estimates**.

---

## 8. Interpretation

In SPU:

- the cosmological constant is not fundamental
- it is tied to fermionic dynamics
- it is linked to gauge unification and gravity emergence

Vacuum energy appears as a residual defect of an otherwise saturated fermionic vacuum.

---

## 9. Status and Falsifiability

This derivation:

- is parameter-free beyond $\delta$
- makes no claim of exact numerical prediction
- is falsifiable if $\delta \to 0$ or if gravity does not emerge at $M_{\mathrm{GUT}}$

---

## 10. Conclusion

The SPU framework provides a unified dynamical origin for:

- gauge unification
- emergent gravity
- vacuum energy

The cosmological constant is reinterpreted as a finite, dynamical residue of fermionic incompleteness rather than a fundamental constant.
