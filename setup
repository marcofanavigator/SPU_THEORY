## 🚀 Quick Start: Data Setup

To replicate the results, you need to download the official datasets and place them in the project directory.

### 1. Galaxy Dynamics (SPARC)
* **Source**: Download from [SPARC Official Site](http://astroweb.cwru.edu/SPARC/).
* **Setup**: Place the raw data files in a folder named `/raw` within the main directory.
* **Execution**: Run `SPU_ACDM_MOND_CONFRONTO.py`.

### 2. Cluster Dynamics (SDSS DR8)
* **Source**: Download catalogs `J_ApJS_224_1_mmb_dr8.csv` and `J_ApJS_224_1_cat_dr8.csv`.
* **Setup**: Place these files directly in the root folder (same level as the Python scripts).
* **Execution**: Run `spu_cluster_analysis.py`.

*Note: Due to the large file these datasets are not hosted on this repository but are publicly available for independent verification.*
