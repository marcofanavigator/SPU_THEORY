# Why Gravity Does Not Run in the SPU Framework

## Abstract

This document explains why gravity does not undergo renormalization group (RG) running in the SPU framework, in contrast with gauge interactions. The argument is structural and does not rely on perturbative quantum gravity or UV completions. Gravity is shown to emerge as a collective infrared response of the SPU medium, placing it outside the standard RG framework governing gauge couplings.

## 1. The RG Conceptual Distinction

Renormalization group running applies to:
- couplings associated with local gauge symmetries,
- interactions mediated by propagating gauge bosons,
- vertex corrections from charged quantum fluctuations.

Gauge interactions satisfy all these conditions.

Gravity in SPU satisfies **none** of them.

## 2. Nature of Gravity in SPU

In SPU, gravity:
- is not a fundamental interaction,
- is not associated with a gauge group,
- has no elementary mediator,
- couples universally to energy–momentum.

It arises as a **collective deformation of the SPU medium**, not as an exchange force.

Therefore, it is conceptually outside the scope of RG flow.

## 3. Absence of a Running Coupling

Gauge couplings are dimensionless and run logarithmically:

$$\alpha_i(\mu) = \frac{g_i^2(\mu)}{4\pi}$$

Gravity is characterized by a **dimensionful** constant:

$$G_N \approx \frac{1}{\Lambda_{\mathrm{SP}}^2}$$

Dimensionful parameters do not run in the same sense. Any scale dependence can be absorbed into field redefinitions or background normalization.

Thus, no RG equation of the form:

$$\frac{dG_N}{d\ln\mu} = \beta(G_N)$$

exists in SPU.

## 4. Collective Origin and IR Dominance

The gravitational response arises from:
- long-wavelength collective modes,
- coherent averaging over $N_f^{\mathrm{eff}}$ degrees of freedom,
- infrared physics only.

RG flow is a UV-to-IR concept. Gravity in SPU is **purely IR-generated**.

As a result:
- UV fluctuations do not renormalize gravity,
- short-distance physics decouples automatically.

## 5. Decoupling from Gauge RG Flow

Gauge RG equations depend on:
- charged fermions,
- gauge bosons,
- local vertex corrections.

The gravitational sector:
- carries no gauge charge,
- does not enter loop corrections,
- has no effect on beta functions.

Therefore:

$$\beta_{\mathrm{gravity}} = 0$$

to all orders in the gauge sector.

## 6. Comparison with Conventional Approaches

In standard quantum gravity approaches:
- gravity is treated as a field theory,
- perturbative non-renormalizability appears,
- RG flow becomes ambiguous.

SPU avoids this entirely by **not quantizing gravity as a fundamental field**.

This is a conceptual advantage, not an omission.

## 7. Stability of the Emergent Scale

Because gravity does not run:
- $\Lambda_{\mathrm{SP}}$ is stable once generated,
- the hierarchy between $M_{\mathrm{GUT}}$ and $\Lambda_{\mathrm{SP}}$ is preserved,
- no logarithmic corrections accumulate.

This explains the long-term stability of Newton's constant.

---

## 8. Falsifiability Conditions

The SPU argument fails if:
1. Newton's constant shows measurable RG running,
2. gravity affects gauge beta functions,
3. gravity acquires gauge-dependent corrections,
4. violations of universality are observed.

Any of these would rule out the framework.

---

## 9. Summary

- RG running applies only to gauge interactions.
- Gravity in SPU is emergent and collective.
- No running coupling exists for gravity.
- The gravitational scale is stable and fixed.
- Gauge and gravity sectors remain consistently decoupled.

This completes the RG consistency analysis of gravity in SPU.
