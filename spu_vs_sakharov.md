# SPU vs Emergent Gravity à la Sakharov

## Abstract

Emergent gravity has a long history, starting from Sakharov's induced gravity paradigm, in which the Einstein–Hilbert action arises from quantum corrections of matter fields.

This document provides a direct comparison between Sakharov-style emergent gravity and the SPU framework, highlighting conceptual similarities, structural differences, and the specific advances introduced by SPU.

## 1. Sakharov's Induced Gravity: Core Idea

In Sakharov's approach (1967), gravity is **not fundamental** but is generated by quantum fluctuations of matter fields in a curved background.

The effective gravitational action emerges as:

$$S_{\text{eff}} \supset \int d^4x \sqrt{-g} \cdot M_{\text{Pl}}^2 \cdot R$$

with:

$$M_{\text{Pl}}^2 \sim N \cdot \Lambda^2$$

where:

- $N$ is the **number of matter fields**
- $\Lambda$ is a **UV cutoff**

### Key Properties

- Gravity is **induced**, not fundamental
- The Planck mass depends **explicitly on a cutoff**
- The number of fields is **external input**

---

## 2. Structural Limitations of Sakharov Gravity

Despite its conceptual importance, the Sakharov framework faces known issues:

1. **Cutoff Dependence**  
   The Planck scale is proportional to an assumed UV cutoff.

2. **No RG Dynamics for N**  
   The number of degrees of freedom is fixed by hand.

3. **No Predictive Scale Selection**  
   The emergence scale of gravity is not dynamically determined.

4. **Background Dependence**  
   Gravity is induced *on* spacetime, not from spacetime dynamics.

## 3. The SPU Starting Point

SPU begins from a **radically different premise**:

$$N_f^{\text{nom}} = 128$$

This number:

- Is **discrete**
- Is **fixed by the underlying fermionic structure**
- Does **not depend on energy scale**

There is **no adjustable cutoff** and no free counting of fields.

## 4. RG Flow as the Central Mechanism in SPU

In SPU, the effective number of fermionic degrees of freedom is **dynamical**:

$$N_f^{\text{eff}}(\mu) = 128 - \delta(\mu)$$

The parameter δ obeys a renormalization group equation:

$$\frac{d\delta}{dt} = 2\delta(1 - \delta)(\gamma_M - 1)$$

This flow:

- Has an **infrared fixed point**
- Is **insensitive to UV initial conditions**
- Yields:

$$\delta_{\text{IR}} \approx 0.63$$

This **replaces the arbitrary choice** of $N$ in Sakharov gravity.

## 5. Emergence of the Planck Scale

In SPU, the effective Planck scale arises as:

$$M_{\text{Pl}}^{\text{eff}} \propto \sqrt{N_f^{\text{eff}}} \cdot \mu_{\text{GUT}}$$

### Key Differences with Sakharov

| Feature | Sakharov | SPU |
|---------|----------|-----|
| **Origin of gravity** | Quantum loops | RG-driven collectivity |
| **Dependence on cutoff** | Yes | No |
| **Degrees of freedom** | External input | Dynamically reduced |
| **Emergence scale** | Arbitrary | Dynamically selected |
| **Universality** | Limited | Unified with gauge sector |

Gravity emerges **at the same scale** where:

- Gauge couplings converge
- RG flow of δ freezes

## 6. Conceptual Upgrade Introduced by SPU

SPU can be understood as a **renormalization-complete** version of induced gravity:

**Sakharov:**
> Gravity is induced by matter fluctuations

**SPU:**
> Gravity emerges when RG flow exhausts the fermionic capacity

In SPU:

- The **weakness of gravity is explained**
- The **Planck scale is not fundamental**
- **Gravity is the infrared phase** of the same dynamics governing particle physics

---

## 7. Background Independence

A crucial conceptual distinction:

**Sakharov Gravity:**  
Spacetime is a **background** on which gravity is induced.

**SPU:**  
Gravity **signals the breakdown** of the particle description itself.

This places SPU closer to:

- Condensed-matter analog gravity
- Holographic intuition
- RG-based emergence

## 8. Summary Table

| Aspect | Sakharov | SPU |
|--------|----------|-----|
| **Gravity fundamental?** | No | No |
| **RG dynamics** | Implicit | Central |
| **Field counting** | Arbitrary | Fixed + dynamical |
| **Cutoff dependence** | Strong | None |
| **Predictive power** | Limited | High |
| **Connection to SM** | Weak | Direct |

---

## 9. Conclusion

Sakharov's induced gravity provided the **first consistent argument** that gravity need not be fundamental.

SPU **extends this idea** by embedding gravity emergence into a fully dynamical RG framework with a fixed fermionic capacity.

In this sense, **SPU does not compete with Sakharov gravity** — it **completes it**.
