# From the RG Flow of δ to Emergent Gravity in the SPU Framework

## Abstract

In the SPU framework, gravity does not appear as a fundamental interaction but **emerges dynamically** from the collective behavior of fermionic degrees of freedom.

This document presents a unified conceptual chain linking the renormalization group (RG) flow of the parameter δ to the emergence of an effective gravitational scale. The key result is that the same RG dynamics responsible for the reduction of effective fermionic degrees of freedom also determines the scale at which gravity becomes operative.

## 1. Discrete Capacity and Dynamical Reduction

The starting point of SPU is a fixed, discrete fermionic capacity determined by the underlying geometric structure:

$$N_f^{\text{nom}} = 128$$

This number is **not adjustable** and does not depend on energy scale.

However, interactions induce a **dynamical reduction** of the degrees of freedom that actively participate in RG running:

$$N_f^{\text{eff}}(\mu) = N_f^{\text{nom}} - \delta(\mu)$$

The parameter δ(μ) quantifies **partial decoupling** rather than the removal of states.

---

## 2. RG Origin of δ

The parameter δ is governed by a renormalization group equation of the form:

$$\frac{d\delta}{dt} = 2\delta(1 - \delta)(\gamma_M - 1)$$

where:

- $t = \ln(\mu / \mu_0)$ is the **RG time**
- $\gamma_M$ is the **anomalous dimension** of quasi-critical fermionic modes

This flow has two generic properties:

- **δ = 0 is unstable**
- **δ flows to a stable infrared fixed point** $\delta^*$

Explicit RG integration yields:

$$\delta^* \approx 0.63$$

This value is **dynamically selected** and **insensitive to UV initial conditions**.

## 3. Physical Meaning of the Fixed Point

At the infrared fixed point:

$$N_f^{\text{eff}} \approx 128 - 0.63 \approx 127.37$$

This effective number controls:

- The **strength of gauge coupling running**
- The **unification scale** of interactions
- The **collective behavior** of the fermionic medium

The RG flow therefore converts a discrete geometric capacity into a continuous, physical parameter.

## 4. Collective Fermionic Medium

Below the unification scale, the fermionic sector behaves as a dense, interacting medium characterized by:

- Large occupation number
- Partial mass generation
- Collective excitations

In this regime:

- Individual particle descriptions lose validity
- Long-wavelength collective modes dominate

This transition is not imposed but **triggered dynamically by the RG flow of δ**.

---

## 5. Emergence of a Gravitational Scale

The effective Planck scale in SPU is determined by the collective fermionic content:

$$M_{\text{Pl}}^{\text{eff}} \propto \sqrt{N_f^{\text{eff}}} \cdot \mu_{\text{GUT}}$$

where:

- $\mu_{\text{GUT}}$ is the **dynamically generated unification scale**

As δ approaches its fixed point:

- $N_f^{\text{eff}}$ stabilizes
- The gravitational coupling becomes scale-independent
- **Gravity emerges as an effective interaction**

Gravity therefore appears **at the same scale** where RG flow freezes.

---

## 6. Why Gravity Emerges at the GUT Scale

The RG flow of δ naturally stops near the unification scale:

$$\mu \approx 10^{16} \text{ GeV}$$

At this point:

- Gauge couplings converge
- Fermionic decoupling saturates
- Collective modes dominate

There is **no need** to postulate:

- A fundamental graviton
- An independent Planck scale
- Additional unifying symmetries

**Gravity emerges** because the fermionic medium has reached maximal collective organization.

## 7. Unified Interpretation

The full logical chain is:

```
Geometric capacity (128)
        ↓
    RG flow of δ
        ↓
  Reduction to N_f^eff
        ↓
Collective fermionic medium
        ↓
Emergent gravitational interaction
```

The same RG mechanism underlies:

- Gauge unification
- Fermionic decoupling
- Gravity emergence

## 8. Conceptual Advantages of SPU

This framework:

- **Avoids** introducing gravity as a separate sector
- **Explains** why gravity is weak
- **Ties** the gravitational scale to particle physics dynamics
- **Remains falsifiable** through RG and cosmological predictions

**Gravity is not added to SPU** — it is a consequence of it.

---

## 9. Summary

- δ flows **dynamically** to an infrared fixed point
- This fixes the **effective fermionic content**
- The **collective fermionic medium** generates gravity
- The **gravitational scale** coincides with the unification scale

**Conclusion:** The emergence of gravity in SPU is therefore a **direct outcome of renormalization group dynamics**.
