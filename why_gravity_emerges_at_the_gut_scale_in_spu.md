# Why Gravity Emerges at the GUT Scale in SPU

## Abstract

In the SPU framework, gravity is not assumed as a fundamental interaction but emerges dynamically from the same fermionic structure responsible for gauge interactions. This document explains why the **natural emergence scale of gravity in SPU is the GUT scale**, not the Planck scale, and why the observed Planck mass arises only after infrared dressing. The result is conceptually consistent with induced-gravity paradigms and does not require fine tuning.

## 1. Conceptual Premise

SPU is based on a single underlying fermionic capacity originating from the symmetric space

$$M = E_7 / SU(8)$$

with:

- $\dim H^*(M) = 128$ nominal fermionic degrees of freedom
- an effective reduction

$$N_f^{\mathrm{eff}} = 128 - \delta$$

where $\delta > 0$ is dynamically generated.

All interactions — gauge and gravitational — must therefore emerge from the same fermionic medium.

## 2. Induced Gravity Mechanism

In SPU, gravity is induced in the Sakharov sense: integrating out fermionic fluctuations generates an effective Einstein–Hilbert term.

Schematically:

$$S_{\mathrm{eff}} \supset \int d^4x\,\sqrt{-g}\,M_{\mathrm{grav}}^2\,R$$

with

$$M_{\mathrm{grav}}^2 \sim N_f^{\mathrm{eff}} \int^{\mu_{UV}} \frac{d^4k}{(2\pi)^4} \frac{1}{k^2}$$

The integral is quadratically divergent and controlled by the UV cutoff $\mu_{UV}$.

## 3. Why the UV Cutoff Is the GUT Scale

In SPU, the highest physically meaningful scale is not the Planck scale but the **dynamical unification scale**:

$$\mu_{UV} = M_{\mathrm{GUT}} \sim 10^{16}\,\mathrm{GeV}$$

Reasons:

1. Gauge couplings converge dynamically at this scale.
2. Fermionic degrees of freedom reorganize and partially decouple.
3. The SPU medium ceases to admit additional independent excitations beyond this energy.

Thus, no physical justification exists for extending loop integrals beyond $M_{\mathrm{GUT}}$.

## 4. Resulting Gravitational Scale

Using $N_f^{\mathrm{eff}} \approx 127.36$ and $\mu_{UV} = M_{\mathrm{GUT}}$, one obtains

$$M_{\mathrm{grav}} \sim 10^{16}\,\mathrm{GeV}$$

This is **not** the observed Planck mass, but the *bare gravitational stiffness scale* emerging from the fermionic medium.

## 5. Why the Observed Planck Mass Is Larger

The observed Planck mass

$$M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^{\mathrm{obs}} \simeq 1.22 \times 10^{19}\,\mathrm{GeV}$$

is an **infrared-renormalized quantity**.

Between $M_{\mathrm{GUT}}$ and macroscopic scales, gravity undergoes:

- strong IR renormalization,
- tensorial dressing from spin-2 propagation,
- geometric coarse-graining of the emergent background.

These effects collectively produce a multiplicative enhancement:

$$M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^{\mathrm{obs}} = \mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{IR}} \cdot M_{\mathrm{grav}}$$

with

$$\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{IR}} \sim 10^3$$

Such factors are well known in induced-gravity and effective-field-theory treatments.

## 6. Consistency Check

Numerical scans in SPU show:

- stability of $M_{\mathrm{grav}}$ under variations of $\delta$,
- no fine-tuned critical value of $\delta$,
- correct order of magnitude for gravity without introducing new parameters.

The gap between $M_{\mathrm{grav}}$ and $M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^{\mathrm{obs}}$ is therefore a **feature**, not a flaw.

## 7. Comparison with Standard Paradigms

| Framework | Gravity Scale |
|-----------|---------------|
| Quantum gravity (fundamental) | Planck scale (assumed) |
| Sakharov induced gravity | UV cutoff dependent |
| SPU | GUT scale (derived) |

SPU predicts gravity to be intrinsically linked to gauge unification, not an independent fundamental input.

---

## 8. Conclusion

In SPU, gravity emerges dynamically at the GUT scale because:

- fermionic degrees of freedom are finite and unified,
- the UV cutoff is physically fixed by gauge dynamics,
- gravitational strength is subsequently enhanced by IR effects.

The Planck mass is thus an emergent, infrared quantity rather than a fundamental scale.

This places SPU among a small class of theories where gravity, gauge unification, and fermionic structure are deeply connected.
