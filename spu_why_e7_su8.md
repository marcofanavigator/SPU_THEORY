# Why E₇/SU(8)?

## Geometric Selection Principle in the SPU Framework

## Abstract

The SPU framework is built upon a topological field defined on a compact symmetric space. Among all possible candidates, the coset space $E_7/SU(8)$ plays a distinguished role. In this section we explain why this choice is **not arbitrary**, but follows from a set of minimal and physically motivated selection criteria. We show that $E_7/SU(8)$ is the **unique known space** satisfying all requirements simultaneously, while alternative constructions fail at least one essential consistency condition.

## 1. Requirements of the SPU Framework

Any geometric background suitable for SPU must satisfy the following **non-negotiable physical requirements**:

### (R1) Compactness and finiteness

The space must be compact in order to yield:
- a finite-dimensional cohomology,
- a discrete and finite capacity of degrees of freedom.

This excludes non-compact symmetric spaces and generic cosets with continuous moduli.

---

### (R2) Simple connectedness

The space must be simply connected to:
- avoid additional topological sectors,
- prevent unphysical global charges,
- ensure a unique vacuum sector.

---

### (R3) Large but finite cohomological capacity

SPU requires:
- a **large** number of nominal degrees of freedom,
- but strictly **finite**.

This capacity is identified with

$$N_f^{\mathrm{nom}} = \dim H^*(M)$$

Too small a value cannot reproduce observed RG flows; infinite-dimensional cases are excluded.

---

### (R4) Absence of continuous moduli

Continuous moduli lead to:
- uncontrolled IR instabilities,
- arbitrary parameters,
- loss of predictivity.

The background space must therefore be **rigid**, with no moduli except overall scale.

---

### (R5) Compatibility with fermionic structures

The geometry must admit:
- spin or spin$^c$ structures,
- consistent coupling to fermionic fields,
- representations allowing partial dynamical decoupling.

---

## 2. Classification of Candidate Spaces

Given the above requirements, the viable candidates are severely restricted.

### 2.1 Classical symmetric spaces

Spaces of type:
- $SU(N)/SO(N)$,
- $SU(N)/Sp(N)$,
- Grassmannians,

either:
- possess continuous moduli,
- or yield too small cohomological capacity,
- or lack rigidity.

They fail (R3) or (R4).

---

### 2.2 Product spaces

Products of simpler manifolds generically:
- introduce multiple scales,
- generate independent moduli,
- spoil universality.

They fail (R4).

---

### 2.3 Exceptional symmetric spaces

This leaves **exceptional Lie groups** and their compact symmetric cosets.

Among these, very few candidates exist.

---

## 3. The Special Role of $E_7/SU(8)$

The coset

$$M = E_7/SU(8)$$

satisfies **all** SPU requirements simultaneously.

### 3.1 Finite and maximal cohomological capacity

The de Rham cohomology is known (Borel):

$$H^*(E_7/SU(8)) \cong \mathbb{Q}[x_4, x_{12}, x_{20}, x_{28}, x_{36}, x_{44}, x_{52}]$$

yielding:

$$\dim H^*(M) = 2^7 = 128$$

This is:
- large enough to support realistic RG dynamics,
- finite and discrete,
- determined purely by topology.

---

### 3.2 Rigidity

$E_7/SU(8)$ has:
- no continuous moduli,
- fixed symmetric structure,
- unique metric up to scale.

This ensures predictivity and stability.

---

### 3.3 Fermionic compatibility

The subgroup $SU(8)$:
- admits complex representations,
- allows chiral fermions,
- naturally supports partial decoupling mechanisms.

This is crucial for the emergence of an effective $N_f^{\mathrm{eff}} < N_f^{\mathrm{nom}}$.

---

### 3.4 Maximal exceptional case

Among exceptional groups:
- $E_6$ yields too small capacity,
- $E_8$ leads to overly rigid or trivial cosets,
- $E_7$ is the **maximal case** compatible with fermionic dynamics and rigidity.

Thus, $E_7/SU(8)$ sits at a unique balance point.

---

## 4. Universality Argument

Even if one starts from a more general background, SPU suggests that:

> any geometry satisfying (R1–R5) flows effectively toward the universality class of $E_7/SU(8)$.

In this sense, $E_7/SU(8)$ is not merely a choice, but an **attractor** in theory space.

---

## 5. Why Not Something Else?

| Candidate | Failure mode |
|-----------|-------------|
| $SU(N)/SO(N)$ | Continuous moduli |
| Grassmannians | Insufficient capacity |
| Product spaces | Loss of universality |
| Non-compact cosets | Infinite capacity |
| $E_6$-based cosets | Too small |
| $E_8$-based cosets | Overconstrained |

No known alternative satisfies all constraints simultaneously.

---

## 6. Conclusion

The choice of $E_7/SU(8)$ in SPU is not aesthetic nor arbitrary. It follows from a **geometric selection principle** based on:

- finiteness,
- rigidity,
- fermionic compatibility,
- maximal but controlled capacity.

Within the space of known symmetric geometries, $E_7/SU(8)$ emerges as the **unique viable background** for the SPU framework.
