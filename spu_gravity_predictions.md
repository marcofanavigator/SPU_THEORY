# Gravitational Predictions in the SPU Framework

## Abstract

This document summarizes the concrete gravitational predictions of the SPU framework. Since gravity emerges dynamically at a characteristic scale rather than being fundamental, SPU makes specific, falsifiable predictions for primordial gravitational waves, proton decay, and the absence of short-distance quantum gravity effects. These predictions distinguish SPU from standard quantum gravity and grand unification scenarios.

## 1. Emergent Gravitational Scale

In SPU, gravity emerges at a single dynamically generated scale:

$$\Lambda_{\mathrm{SP}} \approx M_{\mathrm{GUT}} \approx 10^{16}\,\mathrm{GeV}$$

This scale is fixed by:
- the fermionic capacity of the SPU medium,
- the effective number of degrees of freedom,
- the RG structure of the gauge sector.

No independent Planck-scale parameter is introduced.

## 2. Tensor-to-Scalar Ratio (r)

Because gravity emerges at a finite scale rather than at arbitrarily high energies, primordial tensor modes are suppressed but non-zero.

SPU predicts:

$$r \approx 0.01 \text{ – } 0.05$$

This range:
- is below current exclusion bounds,
- lies within reach of near-future CMB experiments.

### Experimental Relevance

- BICEP/Keck
- LiteBIRD
- CMB-S4

A value of $r \ll 10^{-3}$ would strongly disfavor SPU.

## 3. Absence of UV Quantum Gravity Signatures

SPU predicts **no observable effects** from:
- trans-Planckian physics,
- spacetime discreteness,
- Lorentz-violating operators,
- higher-curvature corrections at accessible scales.

In particular:
- no running of Newton's constant,
- no modification of dispersion relations,
- no black-hole remnants.

Any confirmed UV quantum gravity signal below $\Lambda_{\mathrm{SP}}$ would falsify SPU.

## 4. Proton Lifetime

Because the gravitational and gauge emergence scales coincide, baryon-number violation is suppressed but finite.

SPU predicts:

$$\tau_p \approx 10^{34} \text{ – } 10^{35}\,\mathrm{years}$$

This lies:
- above current Super-Kamiokande bounds,
- within reach of next-generation detectors.

### Experimental Relevance

- Hyper-Kamiokande
- DUNE

Non-observation beyond $10^{36}$ years would challenge the framework.

---

## 5. Gravitational Wave Background

SPU predicts a stochastic gravitational-wave background with:
- primordial origin,
- characteristic cutoff at $\Lambda_{\mathrm{SP}}$,
- no enhancement from UV physics.

Possible signatures:
- smooth power spectrum,
- absence of high-frequency anomalies.

### Experimental Relevance

- LISA
- DECIGO
- Einstein Telescope

Detection of strong high-frequency excesses would contradict SPU.

## 6. No Graviton as a Fundamental Particle

In SPU:
- the graviton is not elementary,
- it is an effective excitation of the medium,
- quantization is approximate and IR-limited.

This implies:
- no graviton self-coupling divergences,
- no need for UV completion of gravity.

Any observation of fundamental graviton properties at arbitrarily high energy would falsify the model.

---

## 7. Summary of Predictions

SPU predicts:
- a finite gravitational emergence scale,
- a moderate tensor-to-scalar ratio,
- absence of UV quantum gravity effects,
- a testable proton lifetime,
- a smooth primordial gravitational-wave background.

These predictions are concrete and experimentally accessible.

## 8. Falsifiability Checklist

SPU is ruled out if any of the following are observed:
1. Significant RG running of Newton's constant,
2. UV quantum gravity signatures below $\Lambda_{\mathrm{SP}}$,
3. Tensor-to-scalar ratio far below $10^{-3}$,
4. Proton lifetime exceeding $10^{36}$ years,
5. Gauge-dependent gravitational corrections.
