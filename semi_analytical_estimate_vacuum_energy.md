# Semi-Analytical Estimate of Vacuum Energy in SPU

## Abstract

Having established that vacuum energy in the SPU framework is non-extensive, this document provides a semi-analytical estimate of its natural magnitude. Without invoking fine tuning or microscopic cutoffs, we show that the only consistent scaling for vacuum energy in SPU is proportional to a cosmological curvature scale multiplied by the emergent gravitational coupling. This places the vacuum energy close to the observed order of magnitude by construction.

## 1. Scope and Strategy

This document does **not** aim to compute the cosmological constant exactly.

Its goal is more limited and robust:

- Identify the *correct scaling law* for vacuum energy in SPU
- Show why it is naturally small
- Demonstrate consistency with emergent gravity and RG flow

Only order-of-magnitude accuracy is claimed.

## 2. Ingredients from the SPU Framework

From previous results, SPU provides the following established elements:

| Quantity | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Fermionic capacity | $N_f^{\text{nom}} = 128$ |
| Effective reduction | $N_f^{\text{eff}} = 128 - \delta$, with $\delta > 0$ |
| Emergent Planck mass | $M_{\text{Pl}}^2 \sim N_f^{\text{eff}} \times \mu_{\text{GUT}}^2$ |
| Gravitational sector | Dynamically generated, tied to RG flow |

Vacuum energy must be constructed from these quantities alone.

## 3. What Vacuum Energy Represents in SPU

In SPU, vacuum energy is **not** a sum of zero-point energies.

Instead, it represents:

- Residual structural tension from incomplete saturation
- A global response of the fermionic medium
- A background curvature contribution

Therefore, it must couple to gravity in the same way curvature does.

---

## 4. Dimensional Analysis with Physical Meaning

The only quantities available with physical meaning are:

- $\delta$ — dimensionless saturation deficit
- $M_{\text{Pl}}$ — emergent gravitational scale
- $H$ — cosmological curvature scale

The unique scalar combination with dimensions of energy density is:

$$\rho_\Lambda \sim \delta \times H^2 \times M_{\text{Pl}}^2$$

No other combination is both dimensionally and physically consistent.

---

## 5. Interpretation of the Scaling

This expression implies:

- Vacuum energy vanishes if $\delta \to 0$
- Vacuum energy vanishes if spacetime curvature vanishes
- Vacuum energy is bounded by the gravitational response

This is exactly the behavior expected for an emergent, non-local vacuum.

## 6. Numerical Estimate

Using observed cosmological values:

$$H_0 \sim 10^{-33} \text{ eV}$$
$$M_{\text{Pl}} \sim 10^{18} \text{ GeV}$$
$$\delta \sim O(0.1 \text{–} 1)$$

One obtains:

$$\rho_\Lambda \sim 10^{-47} \text{ GeV}^4$$

which matches the observed dark energy density within order unity. **No tuning of $\delta$ is required.**

---

## 7. Comparison with Standard Approaches

| Framework | Scaling of Vacuum Energy |
|:----------|:------------------------|
| QFT (Standard) | $\Lambda_{\text{UV}}^4$ |
| SUSY (broken) | $m_{\text{SUSY}}^4$ |
| **SPU** | $\delta \times H^2 \times M_{\text{Pl}}^2$ |

SPU replaces microscopic extensivity with macroscopic consistency.

---

## 8. Robustness of the Estimate

This estimate is robust because:

- It does **not** depend on UV completion details
- It survives variations in $\delta$
- It is insensitive to high-energy thresholds

Only the existence of emergent gravity and finite capacity is required.

---

## 9. Limitations

SPU does not yet predict:

- The exact numerical value of $\Lambda$
- Its possible time dependence
- Deviations from $w = -1$

These require a full cosmological implementation.

---

## 10. Falsification Criteria

SPU would be falsified if:

- Vacuum energy scaled with a microscopic cutoff
- $\Lambda$ were independent of curvature
- Gravity were not emergent from fermionic dynamics

---

## 11. Conclusion

In SPU, vacuum energy emerges as a sub-extensive, curvature-controlled quantity. A semi-analytical estimate shows that its natural magnitude is close to the observed value **without fine tuning**. This resolves the scaling problem of the cosmological constant and integrates dark energy consistently into the SPU framework.
