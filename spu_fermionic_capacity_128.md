# Why the Fermionic Capacity Equals 128

## Robustness and Non-Adjustability in the SPU Framework

## Abstract

The SPU framework assumes a fixed nominal fermionic capacity $N_f^{\mathrm{nom}} = 128$. This document explains why this number is rigid, non-adjustable, and not a phenomenological input. The argument is structural and does not depend on fitting low-energy observables.

## 1. Meaning of Fermionic Capacity

In SPU, the fermionic capacity represents:
- the maximal number of independent fermionic degrees of freedom
- compatible with the underlying geometric and algebraic structure.

It is not the number of propagating particles at low energy.

---

## 2. Origin of Discreteness

The value 128 arises from:
- a finite-dimensional internal structure,
- a discrete spectrum of admissible fermionic modes,
- global consistency conditions.

Once the structure is fixed, the capacity is fixed.

## 3. Why Continuous Deformations Are Excluded

Changing $N_f^{\mathrm{nom}}$ would require:
- altering the dimensionality of the internal space,
- modifying the algebraic closure conditions,
- breaking symmetry assumptions.

These are not small deformations but different theories.

---

## 4. Independence from δ

The reduction parameter $\delta$:
- modifies how many modes effectively contribute,
- does not alter the total capacity.

Thus:

$$N_f^{\mathrm{eff}} = 128 - \delta \quad \text{with} \quad N_f^{\mathrm{nom}} = 128 \;\text{fixed}$$

---

## 5. Non-Fit Nature of 128

The value 128 is determined before:
- RG running,
- matching to low-energy observables,
- comparison with experimental data.

It is therefore not adjusted to reproduce any specific measurement.

## 6. Falsification Implication

If it were shown that:
- the underlying structure admits a different capacity,
- or that the capacity must vary continuously,

then SPU would be falsified at a foundational level.

---

## 7. Conclusion

The value $N_f^{\mathrm{nom}} = 128$ is:
- discrete,
- rigid,
- theory-defining.

$$\boxed{N_f^{\mathrm{nom}} = 128 \text{ is not a parameter but a structural consequence of SPU}}$$
