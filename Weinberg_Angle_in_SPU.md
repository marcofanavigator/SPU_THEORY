# Dynamical Unification of the Three Gauge Interactions in SPU

## Abstract

In the SPU framework, the three gauge interactions of the Standard Model are unified dynamically rather than by group embedding. This document clarifies the precise meaning of unification in SPU and its theoretical and numerical basis.

## 1. What Unification Means in SPU

SPU does not assume:
- a simple unified gauge group,
- supersymmetry,
- fine-tuned threshold corrections.

Instead, unification is defined as the emergence of a common high-energy scale at which gauge couplings converge due to shared dynamical origin.

---

## 2. Common Fermionic Origin

All fermionic degrees of freedom originate from a single underlying structure, fixing a nominal capacity:

$$N_f^{\mathrm{nom}} = 128$$

Dynamical effects reduce the effective number contributing to RG running:

$$N_f^{\mathrm{eff}} = 128 - \delta, \quad \delta > 0$$

The same $N_f^{\mathrm{eff}}$ enters all gauge sectors.

## 3. Unified RG Structure

All gauge couplings evolve according to the same one-loop equation:

$$\frac{d\alpha_i}{d\ln\mu} = -\frac{b_i}{2\pi}\alpha_i^2$$

with coefficients:

$$b_i = b_i^{\mathrm{gauge}} - b_i^{\mathrm{matter}}(N_f^{\mathrm{eff}})$$

No sector-specific parameters are introduced.

## 4. Emergent Convergence Scale

Solving the RG equations shows that:
- $SU(2)_L$ and $SU(3)_c$ couplings converge naturally,
- the convergence occurs at

$$M_{\mathrm{GUT}} \sim 10^{16}\,\mathrm{GeV}$$

- without supersymmetry or tuning.

This scale is an output, not an input.

## 5. The Role of the U(1) Sector

The Abelian $U(1)_Y$ interaction:
- is not asymptotically free,
- has a conventional normalization.

In SPU, exact equality with non-Abelian couplings is not required. Consistency only demands perturbativity up to $M_{\mathrm{GUT}}$, which is satisfied automatically for the same $N_f^{\mathrm{eff}}$.

---

## 6. Nature of the Unification

Unification in SPU consists of:
- common fermionic capacity,
- common dynamical reduction,
- common RG flow,
- common emergence scale.

It is a **dynamical unification**, not a group-theoretic one.

---

## 7. Conclusion

The three gauge interactions are unified in SPU because they emerge from the same underlying fermionic structure and evolve coherently under RG flow. This provides a consistent and falsifiable alternative to traditional grand unification.
