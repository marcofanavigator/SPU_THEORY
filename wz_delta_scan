Requiring compatibility with observational bounds on the dark-energy equation 
of state forces the SPU parameter δ to approach an infrared fixed point such that δ(H)H² remains approximately constant. 
ΛCDM therefore emerges as the low-energy attractor of the theory, with small, controlled deviations.
