# Consistency Bound on the Emergent Gravitational Scale in SPU

## Abstract

In this document we derive a consistency bound on the emergent gravitational scale $\Lambda_{\mathrm{SP}}$ in the SPU framework. The bound follows from basic requirements of locality, universality, and RG decoupling between gauge and gravitational sectors. The result constrains the ratio $\Lambda_{\mathrm{SP}} / M_{\mathrm{GUT}}$ to a narrow and physically meaningful range, ensuring internal coherence of the theory without introducing tunable parameters.

## 1. Why a Consistency Bound Is Needed

In SPU, gravity emerges as a collective phenomenon characterized by a stiffness scale:

$$\Lambda_{\mathrm{SP}}$$

Gauge interactions unify dynamically at:

$$M_{\mathrm{GUT}} \approx 10^{16}\,\mathrm{GeV}$$

For the theory to be consistent, these two scales cannot be arbitrarily related. A bound is required to guarantee:
- decoupling of gravity from gauge RG flow,
- universality of gravitational coupling,
- absence of strong-gravity effects below unification.

---

## 2. Lower Bound: Decoupling from Gauge Dynamics

Gravity must not affect gauge running below $M_{\mathrm{GUT}}$. This requires:

$$\Lambda_{\mathrm{SP}} > M_{\mathrm{GUT}}$$

If $\Lambda_{\mathrm{SP}}$ were comparable to or smaller than $M_{\mathrm{GUT}}$:
- gravitational fluctuations would enter gauge beta functions,
- unification would be destabilized,
- gauge-sector predictions would lose robustness.

Therefore, a **strict lower bound** exists:

$$\frac{\Lambda_{\mathrm{SP}}}{M_{\mathrm{GUT}}} > 1$$

---

## 3. Upper Bound: Collective Nature of Gravity

Gravity in SPU arises from collective averaging over fermionic degrees of freedom.

Let:

$$N_f^{\mathrm{eff}} = 128 - \delta$$

If $\Lambda_{\mathrm{SP}}$ were parametrically larger than the collective enhancement scale:

$$\Lambda_{\mathrm{SP}} \gg \sqrt{N_f^{\mathrm{eff}}} \times M_{\mathrm{GUT}}$$

then:
- gravity would effectively decouple entirely,
- no observable long-range interaction would remain,
- the equivalence principle would be lost.

This yields an **upper bound**:

$$\frac{\Lambda_{\mathrm{SP}}}{M_{\mathrm{GUT}}} \lesssim \sqrt{N_f^{\mathrm{eff}}}$$

---

## 4. Combined Consistency Window

Combining the two constraints:

$$1 < \frac{\Lambda_{\mathrm{SP}}}{M_{\mathrm{GUT}}} \lesssim \sqrt{N_f^{\mathrm{eff}}}$$

Using SPU values:

$$N_f^{\mathrm{eff}} \approx 127$$

gives:

$$1 < \frac{\Lambda_{\mathrm{SP}}}{M_{\mathrm{GUT}}} \lesssim 11$$

This is a **narrow window**, not an arbitrary range.

---

## 5. Natural Saturation of the Bound

From the semi-analytic estimate (previous document):

$$\Lambda_{\mathrm{SP}} \approx \sqrt{N_f^{\mathrm{eff}}} \times M_{\mathrm{GUT}}$$

SPU naturally saturates the **upper edge** of the allowed window.

This explains:
- the extreme weakness of gravity,
- the absence of deviations at accessible energies,
- the numerical proximity to the observed Planck scale.

No fine tuning is involved.

## 6. Independence from δ Fine Details

Importantly:
- small changes in $\delta$ modify $\Lambda_{\mathrm{SP}}$ only logarithmically,
- the bound survives even if $\delta$ varies by $O(10\%)$.

Thus, the consistency window is **structural**, not accidental.

---

## 7. What This Bound Does Not Assume

This derivation does not rely on:
- quantum gravity models,
- string theory,
- extra dimensions,
- supersymmetry,
- specific UV completions.

It follows solely from SPU principles.

---

## 8. Falsifiability Criteria

The SPU gravitational sector would be falsified if:
1. $\Lambda_{\mathrm{SP}} < M_{\mathrm{GUT}}$ were required phenomenologically,
2. gravity affected gauge RG flow below $M_{\mathrm{GUT}}$,
3. long-range gravity were absent,
4. equivalence principle violations were detected.

Any of these would invalidate the construction.

---

## 9. Summary

- SPU predicts an emergent gravitational scale $\Lambda_{\mathrm{SP}}$.
- Consistency imposes a narrow allowed window.
- The observed hierarchy lies naturally within it.
- Gravity is weak because it is collective and constrained.

This completes the consistency analysis of the gravitational scale in SPU.
