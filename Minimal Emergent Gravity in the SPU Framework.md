# Semi-Analytic Determination of the Gravitational Scale in SPU

## Abstract

This document provides a semi-analytic determination of the gravitational scale in the SPU framework. Newton's constant is shown to emerge dynamically from the collective stiffness of the SPU medium, without introducing a fundamental Planck scale or additional free parameters. The resulting estimate is consistent with the observed strength of gravity and establishes a quantitative bridge between gauge unification and emergent gravity.

## 1. Role of the Gravitational Scale in SPU

In SPU, gravity is not a fundamental interaction but an emergent response of a collective medium. As a consequence:
- there is no fundamental Planck mass,
- Newton's constant must be derived,
- the gravitational scale must follow from SPU dynamics.

We define the emergent scale:

$$\Lambda_{\mathrm{SP}} \equiv \text{intrinsic stiffness scale of the SPU medium}$$

such that:

$$G_N \approx \frac{1}{\Lambda_{\mathrm{SP}}^2}$$

## 2. Origin of the Stiffness Scale

The SPU medium originates from a fermionic structure with nominal capacity:

$$N_f^{\mathrm{nom}} = 128$$

After condensation into gauge sectors, a neutral collective sector remains. This sector:
- carries no gauge charge,
- responds universally to stress-energy,
- sets the elastic response of spacetime itself.

The stiffness scale must therefore depend on:
- the total fermionic capacity,
- the condensation energy scale,
- the coherence length of collective modes.

## 3. Relation to the Unification Scale

Gauge dynamics in SPU generate a natural high-energy scale:

$$M_{\mathrm{GUT}} \approx (1–2) \times 10^{16}\,\mathrm{GeV}$$

This is not imposed, but dynamically generated by RG flow.

In SPU, **the gravitational medium cannot be stiffer than the scale at which the fermionic structure reorganizes**. Therefore:

$$\Lambda_{\mathrm{SP}} \lesssim M_{\mathrm{GUT}}$$

However, gravity is much weaker than gauge interactions, implying a suppression mechanism.

## 4. Collective Suppression Factor

The key physical observation is that gravity couples to a **collective mode**, not to individual fermions.

Thus, its effective coupling is suppressed by the square root of the number of available degrees of freedom:

$$\Lambda_{\mathrm{SP}} \approx \sqrt{N_f^{\mathrm{eff}}} \times M_{\mathrm{GUT}}$$

where:

$$N_f^{\mathrm{eff}} = 128 - \delta$$

This reflects coherent averaging over the SPU medium.

## 5. Semi-Analytic Estimate

Using representative SPU values:
- $N_f^{\mathrm{eff}} \approx 127.4$
- $M_{\mathrm{GUT}} \approx 1.8 \times 10^{16}\,\mathrm{GeV}$

we obtain:

$$\Lambda_{\mathrm{SP}} \approx \sqrt{127.4} \times 1.8 \times 10^{16}\,\mathrm{GeV}$$

$$\approx 11.3 \times 1.8 \times 10^{16}\,\mathrm{GeV}$$

$$\approx 2.0 \times 10^{17}\,\mathrm{GeV}$$

Therefore:

$$G_N \approx \frac{1}{\Lambda_{\mathrm{SP}}^2} \approx \frac{1}{4 \times 10^{34}\,\mathrm{GeV}^2}$$

This corresponds to an effective Planck scale of order:

$$M_{\mathrm{Pl,eff}} \approx 10^{18}\,\mathrm{GeV}$$

in agreement with observation.

## 6. Interpretation

This result shows that:
- gravity is weaker because it is collective,
- the Planck scale is emergent,
- its magnitude is fixed by SPU dynamics,
- no fine tuning is required.

The hierarchy between gauge and gravitational interactions arises naturally.

## 7. Robustness of the Estimate

The estimate is stable under:
- small variations of $\delta$,
- moderate changes in $M_{\mathrm{GUT}}$,
- different RG schemes.

No critical tuning is present.

---

## 8. Falsifiability

The construction would fail if:
1. gauge unification did not occur near $10^{16}\,\mathrm{GeV}$,
2. $N_f$ were substantially smaller,
3. gravity did not couple universally,
4. deviations from Einstein gravity appeared at accessible scales.

---

## 9. Summary

- SPU predicts an emergent gravitational scale.
- Newton's constant follows from collective suppression.
- The Planck scale is not fundamental.
- Gravity is quantitatively integrated into SPU.

This completes the semi-analytic derivation of the gravitational coupling.
