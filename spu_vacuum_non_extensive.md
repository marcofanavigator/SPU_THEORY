# Why Vacuum Energy in SPU Is Non-Extensive

## Abstract

In conventional quantum field theory, vacuum energy is assumed to be an extensive quantity, scaling with the fourth power of a UV cutoff. This assumption leads directly to the cosmological constant problem. In the SPU framework, this assumption is invalid. Vacuum energy arises from incomplete saturation of a finite fermionic capacity and is therefore non-extensive by construction. This document explains why vacuum energy in SPU cannot scale as a local volume density and identifies the correct physical scaling.

## 1. The Standard Assumption and Its Failure

In standard QFT, vacuum energy is estimated as:

$$\rho_{\mathrm{vac}} \sim \Lambda_{UV}^4$$

where $\Lambda_{UV}$ is a microscopic cutoff (often taken near the Planck scale). This assumes:

- local field modes at every spacetime point,
- independent contributions from each mode,
- extensivity with spatial volume.

This assumption produces an energy density exceeding observations by $\sim 10^{120}$ orders of magnitude.

## 2. Finite Capacity in SPU

In SPU, the fundamental structure is not a local quantum field vacuum but a finite-capacity fermionic medium.

Key facts:

- The total fermionic capacity is fixed:

$$N_f^{\mathrm{nom}} = 128$$

- Physical observables depend on the effective number:

$$N_f^{\mathrm{eff}} = N_f^{\mathrm{nom}} - \delta$$

- $\delta$ does not count missing particles, but unsaturated structural modes.

This already violates the extensivity assumption: the vacuum is not composed of independent local oscillators.

## 3. Meaning of Vacuum Energy in SPU

In SPU, vacuum energy represents:

- residual tension due to incomplete saturation,
- a global imbalance of fermionic capacity,
- not a sum over local zero-point energies.

Therefore, vacuum energy is:

- global, not local,
- collective, not additive,
- constrained by the same dynamics that generate gravity.

## 4. Why Vacuum Energy Cannot Scale as M⁴

If vacuum energy scaled as:

$$\rho_{\mathrm{vac}} \sim \delta \times M^4$$

with $M$ a microscopic scale, then:

- $\delta$-modes would behave as local propagating fields,
- the theory would reduce to standard QFT,
- SPU would lose all predictive structure.

But $\delta$-modes:

- are dynamically suppressed,
- do not propagate freely,
- only affect RG flow and emergent gravity.

Thus, $M^4$ scaling is forbidden.

## 5. Sub-Extensive Scaling

In SPU, vacuum energy must scale with the same quantities that define emergent gravity.

The only consistent scale is:

$$\rho_{\mathrm{vac}} \sim \delta \times H^2 \times M_{\mathrm{Pl}}^2$$

where:

- $H$ is a cosmological curvature scale,
- $M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ is the emergent Planck mass,
- $\delta$ controls the degree of saturation.

This scaling is:

- non-extensive,
- horizon-sensitive,
- dynamically generated.

## 6. Relation to Emergent Gravity

Gravity in SPU emerges at the GUT scale via collective fermionic dynamics.

Vacuum energy arises from the same sector and therefore:

- cannot exceed the gravitational response scale,
- must be suppressed by RG flow,
- is linked to spacetime elasticity rather than energy density.

This aligns SPU with the logic of Sakharov, Jacobson, and Padmanabhan, but with a microscopic origin.

## 7. Implications

This explains why:

- vacuum energy is small but nonzero,
- no fine tuning of $\delta$ is required,
- the cosmological constant problem is softened, not shifted.

SPU does not claim to solve $\Lambda$ exactly at this stage, but explains why naive estimates fail.

## 8. Falsifiability

If vacuum energy were found to scale extensively with volume at microscopic scales, SPU would be ruled out.

Conversely, evidence for horizon-based or sub-extensive vacuum energy supports the SPU mechanism.

---

## 9. Conclusion

Vacuum energy in SPU is non-extensive because the underlying degrees of freedom are finite, collective, and dynamically constrained. The failure of $M^4$ scaling is not a problem but a **consistency requirement** of the framework.
